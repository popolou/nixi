This is a simple template that you might use for a mapping application using
Google Maps, jQuery layout, and the Aristo jQuery-UI theme. Off the bat, it'll
give you some visual driving directions, hopefully looking reasonably good
while doing it.

This project has been liberally licensed, in the hopes that people will build
some interesting applications on top of it. So what are you waiting for?

Note that this project uses git submodules to import the Aristo theme. After
cloning you'll want to do this on the command line:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
